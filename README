To interact with Microsoft Word from VIM
Currently supports use of Word's Thesaurus and Speller

Copyright (C) 2004 Suresh Govindachar  <initial><last name><at><yahoo>

System Requirements:
  
   Windows (with MS Word)
   VIM with embedded perl support
   The perl module Win32::OLE (good way to get this is to have external perl)

Exports: 
 
   The following four commands are exported to the end-user:
   
      :WordThesaurus    [<cword>]
      :WordSpell        [<cword>]
      :WordAnagram      [<cword>]
      :<range>WordCheckSpelling 
   
   In regard to the first three commands:
   
    - Each command can be issued with no arguments or with one argument.
      When no argument is provided, the <cword> (see :help cword) is 
      used as the argument.
    - After execution, the "result" is appended below the current line.
    - The "result" for the Thesaurus command is all 
      the synonyms and the antonyms.
    - The "result" for the Spell command is all 
      the spelling suggestions.
    - The "result" for the Anagram command is all 
      the anagrams of the given letters.
   
   Try the following:
   
      :WordThesaurus beautiful
      :WordAnagram   abt
      :WordSpell     helo
      :WordSpell     b?t*
   
   In regard to the fourth command (:<range>WordCheckSpelling):
      
    - The default range is the whole buffer -- in order for
      quickfix commands to work, there has to be a file 
      associated with the buffer.
   
    - Results are:
   
      - highlighting as Error each misspelled word in the range
        (the filetype is set to nothing so that the only colored
        stuff are the misspelled words)
   
      - ability to use the quickfix commands (:cfirst, :cn, etc) to 
        visit each misspelled word and to look at suggestions on spelling it.
   
      - Sub commands (of the :<range>WordCheckSpelling command):
   
           :WordShowMisspelled
                Highlights misspelled words (there won't be any other highlighting)                 
           :WordHideMisspelled
                Restores highlighting based on filetype 
           The next five commands extend the corresponding quickfix 
                commands (:cfirst, :clast, :cc, :cn, :cp) by
                loading the search register with the appropriate 
                misspelled word
                    :Wordfirst
                    :Wordlast
                    :Wordc
                    :Wordn
                    :Wordp
   
      - Optional (controlled by g:no_plugin_maps or g:no_word_maps) 
        normal-mode maps:
           <Leader>ws :WordShowMisspelled<CR>
           <Leader>wh :WordHideMisspelled<CR>
           <Leader>wc :Wordc<CR>
           <Leader>wn :Wordn<CR>
           <Leader>wp :Wordp<CR>

Tested on:

   Windows 98 with Word 97 (and Vim 6.3, ActiveState's perl 5.8).
   Anagram and WildCard NOT supported by Microsoft in later versions of MSWord -- see
   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;224722 !!!

Known issue:
  
   Sometimes Windows and/or Word is sluggish and things
   time-out with a "no service available" or some such 
   error message -- when this happens, just reissue the command.

Acknowledgment:                                                              

   Although I conceived and developed this plugin, I
   learnt how to interact with Microsoft Word for 
   accessing its Thesaurus and Spelling from: 

    - Chad DeMeyer   (microsoft.public.word.word97vba)
    - Steven Manross (perl-win32-users@listserv.ActiveState.com)
    - Greg Chapman   (perl-win32-users@listserv.ActiveState.com)
